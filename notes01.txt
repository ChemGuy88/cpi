According to the Readme from STITCH (http://stitch1.embl.de/download/README), the protein dictionary can be found in another database, STRING. The file is "protein.aliases.v7.1.txt". Its first two lines are:

# ## species_ncbi_taxon_id ## protein_id ## alias ## source ##
# 117	RB2638	1,4-alpha D-glucan:1,4-alpha D-glucan 6-glucosyl- transferase	paralign_SWISSPROT_DE

However, when queried on RefSeq, this tag does not return the same aliases, but rather simply "glycogen branching enzyme".

Looking around STRING we see that they have a map of their datasets (http://string71.embl.de/newstring_download/database.schema.v7.1.pdf). In it they explain that the protein tag comes from third party databases: GenomeReviews, RefSeq, or Ensembl. However, GenomeReviews is now defunct and forwards to Ensembl.

As an example, consider the CPI pair:
# CID000007215 : ('117.RB7803', '229')

117 is the species
RB7803 is the protein

The protein can be found in RefSeq (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). It actually points to a DNA sequence, but it has a protein associated with it (uroporphyrinogen III synthase, uroporhyrinogen decarboxylase)

For another CPI pair,
# CID006918553 : ('7955.ENSDARP00000041069', '278')

ENSDARP... points to a DNA sequence on Ensembl (http://useast.ensembl.org). This only points to a DNA sequence, but the search result yields "ENSDARG00000032319", which is associated with the protein "mest". "ENSDARP00000041069", however, does return results for a DNA sequence that is associated with "mest". I do not understand why this protein tag does not link directly to its associated gene.

The species dictionary is located in file

# species.v7.1.txt

The first two lines are:

# ## taxon_id	STRING_type	STRING_name_compact	official_name_NCBI
# 117	core	Rhodopirellula baltica	Rhodopirellula baltica (strain 1)

The chemicals dictionary is in "chemicals.v1.10.tsv". The first two lines are:

# chemical	name	molecular_weight	SMILES_string
# CID000000001	acetyl-L-carnitine	203.236	CC(=O)OC(CC(=O)[O-])C[N+](C)(C)C

Also, note that the STRING site cited is version 7, and version 10 is available.
